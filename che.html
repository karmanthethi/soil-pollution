          “Soil pollution” refers to the presence of a chemical or substance out of place and/
or present at a higher than normal concentration that has adverse effects on 
any non-targeted organism (FAO and ITPS, 2015). Although the majority of pollutants 
have anthropogenic origins, some contaminants can occur naturally in soils as 
components of minerals and can be toxic at high concentrations. Soil pollution 
often cannot be directly assessed or visually perceived, making it a hidden danger
          </p>

          <p>
           The diversity of contaminants is constantly evolving due to agrochemical and 
industrial developments. This diversity, and the transformation of organic 
compounds in soils by biological activity into diverse metabolites, make soil 
surveys to identify the contaminants both difficult and expensive. The effects of 
soil contamination also depend on soil properties since these control the mobility, 
bioavailability, and residence time of contaminants

        <header>Sources of soil pollution</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            Geogenic and natural sources:
There are debates and uncertainties about the origin of soil contaminants from geogenic sources and those from anthropogenic sources due to human intervention of the geogenic elements/compounds; the elevation of arsenic from ground to surface soil is one of these examples (Barbieri, Sappa and Nigro, 2018). Major soil contaminants, especially trace elements (arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead, mercury and nickel) and hydrocarbons, are important in this regard because of their toxicity to humans and the environment. Three examples of geogenic sources of soil pollution are presented below.
          </p>

          <p>
           Among trace elements, arsenic is considered the most serious mobile contaminant from geogenic sources in this region. Exposure to arsenic can cause human disease, including cancers of the skin, lungs and other internal organs
Several active volcanoes are located in the Asia–Pacific region, in the “Ring of fire”. Volcanic eruptions can emit varying masses of elements, such as arsenic, fluorine, gallium, mercury, sodium, tin, titanium, and zinc (Ma et al., 2019). Of these, arsenic, fluorine and mercury, are important, given their toxicological priority. For example, a moderately sized eruption of Mount Ruapehu, New Zealand, could emit mercury at 100-200 kg/day with potentially much higher emissions when large eruptions occur
          </p>
          <p>
            Anthropogenic Sources:
The main anthropogenic sources of soil pollution are the chemicals used in or 
produced as by-products of industrial activities, domestic and municipal wastes, 
including wastewater, agrochemicals, and petrol-derived products (Figure 3). These 
chemicals are released to the environment accidentally, for example from oil spills 
or leaching from landfills, or intentionally, as is the case with the use of fertilizers 
and pesticides, irrigation with untreated wastewater, or land application of sewage 
sludge.

The range of chemicals used in industrial activities is vast, as is their impact on the 
environment. 
Metal smelting to separate minerals has introduced many pollutants into the soil. 
Mining and smelting facilities release huge quantities of heavy metals and other 
toxic elements to the environment; these persist for long periods, long after the end 
of these activities.
The widespread development of infrastructure such as housing, roads and railways 
has considerably contributed to environmental degradation. Their more evident 
negative effects on soil are soil sealing and land consumption. Apart from these 
known soil threats, another major impact of infrastructure activities is the entry 
into the soil system of different pollutants. Despite its being a major threat, soil 
pollution from infrastructure activities has received very minor consideration in 
terms of planning and impact assessment.

        <article>
          <p>The release of pollutants to the environment, as has been mentioned, usually 
originates from anthropogenic processes. Even if some elements and compounds 
occur naturally in soils, human interventions are the main drivers of soil pollution. 
The following sections discuss only a small subset of the most common pollutants 
affecting agricultural areas, and the properties that make these compounds 
pollutants. Pollutants have been divided by their chemical characteristics, but 
some of the categories presented here overlap. Swartjes proposed a systematic 
categorization of pollutants (Figure 5) that may be useful in better understanding 
them</p><br>

        <header>The impact of soil pollution on the food chain and ecosystem services</header>
        <p>
         The predicted world’s population of over nine billion by 2050 will require the 
provision of enough good quality food and water. According to Dubois, food production will increase by 70 percent 
by 2050 globally, and by 100 percent in developing countries, compared with 2009 
production levels. FAO’s latest projections indicate that global food production will 
increase by 60 percent between 2005/07 and 2050 under its baseline scenario. This 
represents a downward revision, based on updated data and information, from the 
70 percent increase projected for the same period in 2009. The quantity and nutritional quality of food supports human health, and 95 
percent of food production depends on soils. Only 
healthy soils can provide the needed ecosystem services and secure supplies of 
more food and fibre. The provision of ecosystem services has received considerable 
attention and can be defined as “the capacity of natural processes and components 
to provide goods and services that satisfy human needs, directly or indirectly”. Food security is defined as “the availability, access, utilization and stability of 
food supply.” Soil pollution reduces food security both by reducing crop yields due 
to toxic levels of contaminants and by causing the produced crops to be unsafe for 
consumption
        </p>
        <p>
          If a contaminant is highly toxic to plants at low concentrations and is not easily 
translocated to shoots, fruits or tubers to pose a hazard to animals and humans, it 
is unlikely to enter the food chain and become a hazard. This concept was termed 
the “Soil-Plant Barrier” by Chaney almost 40 years ago for metals and metalloids 
(Chaney, 1980). Chaney defined four groups of metals entering the food chain when 
sewage sludge was applied to soil, as a function of their danger to human health 
        </p>
        <p>
         Entry of pollutants directly (release of effluents on land) or indirectly (use of 
polluted water as irrigation to crops) has been reported to contaminate vast areas of 
soil resources and groundwater bodies, affecting crop production as well as human 
and animal health through food contamination

        <article>
          
          <p>
            Oliver and Gregory summarise six soil-related human health risks. Of these, three are related to soil pollution: risks from elemental 
contamination (e.g. As, Cd, Pb); organic chemical contamination (e.g. PCBs, PAHs, 
POPs); and pharmaceutical contamination (e.g. estrogen, antibiotics). The three 
other risks are from soil pathogens such as anthrax and prions, micronutrient 
deficiencies, and undernutrition due to degraded soils.
          </p>
          <p>
           The main pollutants related to industrial, mining, urban, and agricultural land uses 
have been widely discussed in the previous chapters. This section will focus on the 
soil pollutants that are the most relevant to human health and the risks associated 
with them. 
          </p>
          <p>
           The route of human exposure to a soil contaminant will vary depending on the 
contaminant itself and on the conditions and activities at a particular site. Generally, people can be exposed to contaminants present 
in soil through ingestion or through the consumption of plants or animals that 
have accumulated large amounts of soil pollutants through dermal 
exposure, from using spaces such as parks and gardens or by inhaling soil contaminants that have been vaporized. Humans 
may also be affected as a result of secondary contamination of water supplies and 
from deposition of air contaminants in some situations, soils play an important role as the source of 
contaminants in these two processes

        <header>Management and remediation of polluted soils</header>
        <article>
          <p>
           The first step in the assessment and management of polluted soils is the 
identification of the problem; in this case, the pollutions in the soil. In general, 
when an area is affected by an accident such as an oil spill, a nuclear accident, or 
the rupture of a dam tailing, measures to control the extent and prevent further 
occurrences generally start immediately. However, in legacy polluted soils or where 
diffuse pollution could be an issue, there are often no established protocols to be 
followed. In some countries or regions in the world, there are national, regional 
or local agencies who are responsible for initiating a preliminary investigation 
to determine whether or not pollution is present and whether further action is 
needed, while there are many others where no regulation or protocols have been 
defined (Teh et al., 2016). 
In the past, criteria for land reclamation were established using standards 
based on background concentration and safe limits. New approaches try to 
adopt a more comprehensive assessment of the risk that pollutants pose to the 
environment, humans and food safety. The characterization of the potential risk 
to the environment and human health is not an easy task, due to the complexity 
of the matrix, the lack of knowledge on the fate of contaminants in soil and the 
scarcely available information of toxicological and integrated studies (Cachada et al., 
2016). Exposure routes for these compartments modelled taking into consideration 
certain land-use types (e.g. residential, industrial, and recreational)
          </p>

          <p>
            Assessing risks means that, based on scientific evidence, one can estimate the 
likelihood of a certain outcome and the gravity of that outcome, and use this 
knowledge to help in decision-making. Uncertainties must be reduced when 
possible, and clearly, the remaining uncertainties need to be clearly identified 
and explained (FAO, 2000). Risk management decisions for soils or sediments focus 
on identifying relevant pathways of exposure that pose a risk to human health or 
the environment and developing appropriate remedial measures. These could 
include treating or removing sources, or cutting off pathways, or both 
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Risk assessment approaches (RAA) are similar worldwide and consist of a series 
of steps to be taken to identify and evaluate whether exogenous or indigenous 
substances have caused or are causing soil pollution, and to what extent that 
pollution is posing a risk to the environment and to human health (Figure 19). Risk 
assessment approaches are tools to enable science-based political and technical 
decisions and to take action when needed. Risk assessment tools often use a 
chemical-by-chemical approach, focusing on a single medium, a single source, and 
a single toxic endpoint, although integrated approaches are gaining popularity. 
Such approaches use models combining human exposure and effect‑based 
environmental parameters, based on deterministic or probabilistic techniques

        <header>Main techniques for remediating polluted sites</header>
        <article>
          <p>
           Nathanail referred to sustainable remediation as “remediation that eliminates and/
or controls unacceptable risks in a safe and timely manner, and which maximizes 
the overall environmental, social and economic benefits of the remediation work” 
(Nathanail, 2011). Sustainable management requires the incorporation of the best 
available techniques, not only during the remediation process itself, but for the 
whole process, including risk assessment and risk reduction. Best management 
practices (BMPs) are individual or combinations of management, cultural and 
structural practices that researchers (academic or governmental) have identified 
as the most effective and economical way of reducing damage to the environment 
(Cestti, Srivastava and Jung, 2003). Remediation is commonly done on a site-by-site basis, 
since for every combination of pollutant, soil property, land use, property and 
liability regimes and technical and economic reality of the site or area, a different 
technique or combination of techniques may be more appropriate
          </p>

          <p>
            Remediation techniques can be divided in two main groups: in situ (on the site) and 
exsitu (removal of contaminated soil for treatment off the site) remediation. Available 
remediation options include physical, chemical and biological treatments, and 
these options offer potential technical solutions to most soil pollution (Scullion, 2006). 
For both in situ and ex situ, the net effect on the contaminants can be categorized 
as reducing the concentration, reducing the bioavailability without reducing the 
concentration, encapsulating in an inert matrix, containment, and removal (Pierzynski, 
Sims and Vance, 2005). The management of polluted sites is a site‑specific approach that 
includes characterization, risk assessment and remediation technologies selection, 
and therefore is mainly focused on local or point-source contamination. 
Scullion presented a review of the main treatment approaches to remediate 
polluted soils and their effect on pollutants (Scullion, 2006), specifying whether 
they are degraded, separated from soil components, extracted from the matrix or 
stabilized

          <p>The consumption of petroleum oil and lubricants (POL) in field missions is 
inevitable due to their use in generating electricity and operating mechanical 
equipment to support peacekeeping operations. Through these processes, which 
have a major environmental footprint, and the potential for soil contamination arises. 
This section presents a case study of remediation work conducted by Global Service 
Centre/Environmental Technical Support Unit on POL polluted sites during the 
liquidation of a United Nations field operation in Côte d’Ivoire (ONUCI). 
The goal of the project was to reduce the level of total petroleum hydrocarbon 
(TPH) in polluted soil (36 000 to 75 000 mg/kg) to a background TPH level of 400 
to 1,000 mg/kg, providing an enabling environment for the revegetation of plants. The 
project entailed the removal of over 1,200 tonnes of POL-contaminated soil from 
sites and replacing it with fresh soil. The excavated contaminated soil was treated 
using naturally occurring materials derived locally. </p>
          
              <p>The contaminated soil was deposited in a large concrete mixer to tumble and 
aerate in order to promote microbial growth and the breaking down of POL. 
Two ingredients (poultry waste and naturally occurring surface active materials 
(NOSAM) or palm ash soap (also known as black soap)) were added to the mix to 
improve the condition of the soil and to accelerate the microbial remediation.
The result showed a reduction of over 95 percent in TPH levels immediately after 
remediation, with natural microbial activities ensuring more reduction in TPH 
within a 14-day period. Native grasses were planted in the restored areas. The case 
study highlights the importance of implementing low-cost remediation techniques 
in mitigating POL polluted sites within the UN field missions</p>

        <article>
         
          <p>
           The Russian Federation occupies one of the leading places in oil production over the 
globe. More than 70 percent of Russian Federation oil is extracted in the Taiga zone 
of western Siberia. In the 1990s oil-production enterprises of this region experienced 
a drastic increase in pipeline accidents and oil pollution of ecosystems. Under 
conditions of insufficient state control over statutory compliance of environmental 
protection legislation, this led to a significant number of oil-polluted lands that 
have not been remediated for a long time, forming a so-called “historical heritage” 
for new companies that are currently producing oil on this territory.
Oil companies have made significant efforts to restore oil‑polluted lands in the 
last 10–15 years, but this problem has not been completely resolved. This is mostly 
due to the special environmental conditions of the region: the average annual 
temperature ranges from -0.1 °C to -5 °C, the average temperature in January is -18 
°C to -24 °C (with the recorded minimum as -62 °C); the duration of the period with 
a stable snow cover achieves 180–200 days; and precipitation significantly exceeds 
evaporation. The West Siberian lowland is a vast, weakly dissected plain, which 
experienced active development of swamp formation during the Holocene epoch: 
in some areas, swamps cover 90 percent of the territory. Spills therefore occur 
mainly in wetland ecosystems, which greatly complicates the use of machinery for 
reclamation operations.
Not only were there unfavourable weather conditions, but remediation technologies 
were applied that were not appropriate for wetland soils, as they were originally 
developed for mineral soils. Basic technological solutions included surface oil 
pickup (if any), agrotechnical practices (liming, mineral fertilization), biostimulation 
(activation of native oil-oxidizing microorganisms) or bioaugmentation (application 
of commercial bio-products with oil-oxidizing action), periodic loosening and 
phyto-melioration (sowing of meadow grasses). However, for remediation of 
oil-contaminated peat bog soils, some other approaches were needed.
Peat soils have a very high sorption capacity to oil. It is therefore difficult to collect 
spilled oil even immediately after the spill, and after thickening of the oil it is 
impossible. At the same time, the concentration of oil hydrocarbons in the upper, 
most contaminated part of the peat bog soil profile can reach 80 percent or more, 
which is significantly higher than the levels that oil‑destructive microorganisms can 
consume. The above-described traditional technological solutions are therefore 
ineffective, even after being repeated for several processing seasons.
Effectiveness of reclamation is significantly increased if mechanical removal 
(shearing) of the uppermost contaminated layer (usually 10–15 cm) is performed in 
the oil‑contaminated area first. In this layer, in addition to heavy oil hydrocarbons, 
a large number of resins and asphaltenes accumulate. This accumulation 
effectively seals the soil, preventing water and gas transfer. This in turn drastically 
decreases microbiological activity in the contaminated soil. At the initial stage of 
implementation of this technological operation, manual labour was used. This 
explains why despite the high efficiency of remediation on certain oil‑contaminated 
sites, the total area of reclaimed land remained low.

            Mining has been present in Sierra Minera de Cartagena–La Unión (Murcia, Spain) 
for more than 2 500 years. This activity has generated large amounts of tailings 
from the exploitation of mineral sulfides (mainly ZnS and PbS). Tailing ponds were 
abandoned after the cessation of the activity in 1991 and are of great concern due to 
the risk associated with the high content of toxic metal(loid)s.Moreover, these tailings have low fertility, low organic matter content and high acidity. 
Therefore, the establishment of native vegetation is very difficult unless organic 
and/or inorganic amendments are applied (García and Lobo, 2013). Phytoremediation 
is considered an economic and environmentally-conscious method to remediate 
polluted soils (Wan, Lei and Chen, 2016). Among phytoremediation techniques, aided 
phytostabilization can be a solution to reduce the risk of pollutant dispersion (Yang
et al., 2016). Several amendments have been proposed to stabilize metal(loid)s in 
soils (Kumpiene, Lagerkvist and Maurice, 2008). Organic amendments and materials rich in 
carbonates have been successfully used to reduce the bioavailability of metals and 
to restore the ecological function of contaminated soils (Park et al., 2011).
The main goal of this study was to determine the effectiveness of aided 
phytostabilization applied to a tailings pond from Zn/Pb mining 30 months after 
its reclamation. The effectiveness was evaluated by monitoring physicochemical 
and biochemical properties and bioavailable metal(loid) (As, Cd, Pb and Zn) 
contents in the tailings. In addition, the metal(loid) translocation to plant species 
(root, stem and leaf ) and evolution of plant communities were also evaluated. The 
initial hypothesis was that the implementation of phytostabilization with native 
plant species with inorganic and organic amendments would decrease the mobility 
of metal(loid)s, decrease the risks for environment and public health, and increase 
soil quality and fertility and vegetation cover. Plants should accumulate high 
contents of metal(loid)s in their roots with low translocation to shoots.
          </p>

          <p>
            The study was performed in Santa Antonieta tailings pond, located in Cartagena–
La Unión mining district. The pond has a surface of 1.4 ha. Marble waste was used 
as a source of carbonates to neutralize acidity, immobilize metals and develop soil 
structure. Pig slurry and its solid phase (manure) after physical separation was used 
as a source of organic matter and nutrients for soil development and vegetation 
establishment. 
The following species were planted in 2012: Atriplex halimus L., Cistus albidus L., 
Helichrysum stoechas (L.) Moench., Hyparrhenia hirta (L.) Stapf., Lavandula dentata
L., Lygeum spartum (L.) Kunth., Rosmarinus officinalis L., Phagnalon saxatile (L.) Cass, 
Piptatherum miliaceum, Cynodon dactylon, Limonium caesium, Sonchustenerrimus, and 
Atriplex halimus.
The results of the study showed that the combination of marble waste, pig slurry 
and manure was efficient for the reclamation of an acidic tailings pond by aided 
phytostabilization. The technique increased soil pH, CEC, TOC and nutrients 
content, improved soil structure and reduced the mobility of metals, mainly Cd, 
Pb and Zn up to 90–99 percent. Lygeum spartum and Piptatherum miliaceum were 
effective in phytostabilization of Pb, Zn and As, since they accumulated high metal 
concentrations in roots, with low aerial translocation. Atriplex halimus and Phagnalon 
saxatile presented phytotoxic concentrations of Zn in leaves. Therefore, the use of
